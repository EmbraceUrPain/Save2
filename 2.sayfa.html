              <ul type="disc" style="color: blueviolet;">
                <li>
                   <p>Grimm is the amalgamation of many fairytale writers who was a teacher. He was close to the daughters of the Dean, and  was intimate with them. (Don't know where the H ending murder newspaper comes in) Grimm was caught, and it messed him up. When Alice grew up, he had a crisis and begged for her to be young again, and this caused an Outer Being, Mary-Anne, to take notice and transport him into her "Garden", where she used his writing as inspiration.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>An Outer Being named The Crawling One assumed the identity of the young Alice, and along with several other Outer Beings, developed some form of feelings for Grimm. Grimm unknowingly became entrapped in a cycle of making love to or killing the girls in the story, who would be reborn as children-clones to repeat the cycle. In the true ending, Grimm breaks out by facing off against Mary-Ann and breaking that cycle, ending game 1. Mary Ann is struck down and trapped by another Outer God (The Crawling One?).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>In game 2, Grimm loses most of his memory and is placed into a new Garden, seemingly either created by The Crawling One or Grand Guingol. The three Alice's are just pieces of the Crawling One. Node is another Outer Being, who supports Grimm due to having feelings for him. Red Hood is within the story, remembering everything from the first game and wanting to help Grimm break free. The same cycle problem can apply it seems, but progressing to the 'true' Red Hood ending is what I'm going for. Grimm picks up pieces of his real memory along the way to realise Alice isn't real in this world, but is still supernaturally obsessed with her for the most part. Grimm eventually faces Alice after collecting all his stories, and realising she is false, kills her. This leads him and Red Hood to face The Crawling One, but they cannot kill it entirely, just damage it enough to break the Garden. Grimm flees and survives, while Red Hood stays behind to buy time, ending Red Hood path.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>In the Hell ending, Maybell (?), The Outer Being who controls the Chaos Dungeon, helps lead Grimm down a different path. After going through the DLC areas, he finds a false space created by Grand Guingol, a representation of the Garden itself? Maybell betrays Grimm because she has to obey Grand Guingol, but she still also has feelings for Grimm in a sense. After fighting Grand Guingol, Grimm is taken by The Crawling One to be used and tortured. Spared from unending suffering at the hands of The Crawling One by the Daughter Alice part of the Crawling One, but he still ends up trapped in a false reality.
                </li>
                </p>

              <p>This is an adult-oriented RPG, a sequel to "BLACK SOULS". Be warned, as it contains portrayals of cruelty and despair.
In this work you'll meet 34 Heroines. Almost all of them are the fun characters you may have met before in the famous tale "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland". Though, now all of them are charming girls.
(However, the most important for you is Alice of course, isn't that right?)</p>

              <div class="col-12">
                <h3 style="margin:0px 0px 10px 0px;">Souls</h3>
                <p>There are two types of souls - currency and stat enhancements. The first is used to increase the level of the character and all companions. Souls are obtained after killing an enemy or using the souls of dead people. To increase stats:<span style="color:green;"> Green</span>,<span style="color:purple;"> Purple</span>,<span style="color:red;"> Red</span>,<span style="color:blue;"> Blue</span>,<span style="color:yellow;"> Yellow</span>,<span style="color:grey;"> Ashen</span>,<span style="color:white;"> Black</span>, <span style="color:lightgrey;">White</span> and <span style="color:palegoldenrod;">Tainted Black Souls</span>. They can be found at locations or purchased.</p>
              </div>
              

              <div class="col-12">
                <h3 style="margin:0px 0px 10px 0px;">Bonfire</h3>
                <p>Bonfires are used to restore health and mana, as well as for quick teleportation between locations. Unlike Dark Souls, bonfires do not save the player.</p>
                <h3 style="margin:0px 0px 10px 0px;">Companions</h3>
                <p>The player can also find companions in this game, although only in a temporary one-battle form, as opposed to the previous game. Most of the companions the player can encounter are Dream Spirits strewn about the lands of Wonderland. The player can recruit them before batlles with bosses by interacting with their books. Sometimes, for the books to appear, some othe conditions need to be met. The player also needs to not be Hollow, which is a state they get after every death. It can be cured with the <u style="color: lightblue;">Girl's Scent</u> item.</p>
                <h3 style="margin:0px 0px 10px 0px;">SEN</h3>
                <p>A replacement of the Sin meter from the first game, SEN indicates the player's sanity or the lack of it. In the game, having it too low will cause you to see the inhabitants of <span style="color:red">Wonderland</span> as monsters, and will have Nightmare Spirits more likely to attack you.<br><br>

SEN is often more detrimental, the earlier you are into the game. However it is necessary to achieve all the endings, gain a lot of items and witness a lot of special interactions in Black Souls II.<br><br>

It will cause you to see enemies that can not be beaten at earlier levels, be disabled from talking to some people or straight up kill them. It also allows to see memories from before...</p>
